# City-explorer

**Author**: Fikret Aslan
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview

This app tackles a users' frustration by displaying not only the name of the location, but the latitude, longitutude and even map! Would you like to zoom closer to your destination to scope out the cool coffee shops? This app allows you to pinpoint your location exactly, and more.

## Getting started

Before getting started, one must have knowledge on what an API is. An API is an Application Programming Device and it essentially let's multiple apps communicate with each other. After that, you need to ensure you use https://locationiq.com/ as it is a free API (unlike Google and Apple). This API will allow us to make the site interactive and have the user type any destination in the world, even if it is, Earth! You will also need your terminals updated and running and have the latest VSCode launched and ready. Once the set-up is complete, it's simply a game of getting all your code down on the screen (remember to pseudo-code as much as you can as it'll help you - trust me!)

## Architecture

In order for this app to even be created, we need to be using a library called React and the programming language of JavaScript which compliments it. Although the design of the app is still in progress, a subtle and easy-to-use UI will await the user completing their search forms. 

## Changelog

30/10/23 - 16:02. An update has been pushed to GitHub which now correctly displays the location, longitude and latitude. The next update in the changelog will display a map of the location.
